# Query GPT: Natural Language to SQL Query Generator

**Query GPT** is a free, open-source tool that lets anyone convert natural language questions into SQL queries for their own data tables, using local open-source AI models (like Phi-3) — no API keys, no usage limits, and no costs.

## Features

- Upload your own data (CSV or Excel)
- See your table’s schema and preview your data
- Ask questions in plain English (e.g. "Show top 5 customers by revenue")
- Get complete SQL queries instantly, generated by a local LLM (Phi-3)
- 100% private: nothing is sent to external servers

## Tech Stack
